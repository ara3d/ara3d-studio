# Ara 3D Studio

**Ara 3D Studio** is a free Windows desktop application for loading, viewing, and querying large 3D models for architecture, engineering, construction, and urban planning.  

> ⚠️ **Note**: While the Ara 3D Studio application itself is **not open-source** it is free to download and use. 
 
Ara 3D studio is also a 3D parametric toolkit that comes with a fully open-source SDK [Ara 3D SDK](https://github.com/ara3d/ara3d-sdk) which can be used for building C# scripts 
while the application is running or as part of a standalone tools. 

## About this Repository 

This repository is for making releases, tracking issues, and the roadmap.  

## Registration

Ara 3D Studio requires a free registration to be used for commercial purposes. This allows us to track install rates, and to justify our investment of time. 

## Features 

* Loading of glTF, IFC, VIM, OBJ, STL, Collada (DAE) files
* Saving to:
* Creating parametric geometry
* Creating parametric modifiers 

## Our Vision

We believe the future of the built environment depends on software that is as powerful, efficient, and intelligent as the projects it helps create.  

Ara 3D’s vision is to unlock the full potential of modern computing for AEC — enabling instant queries, massive-scale models, and new forms of collaboration that were previously impossible.  

Ara 3D Studio and the Ara 3D SDK are the first steps on this journey. They prove what’s possible when the best ideas from software engineering, graphics, and data science are applied to AEC.

## FAQ

> **Q: How and why is this free?**

By making Ara 3D Studio free, we:  
- Enable as many professionals as possible to benefit from modern performance and workflows  
- Collect feedback that makes our SDK and core technologies stronger  
- Build momentum for the broader ecosystem of commercial services, libraries, and tools that we are developing  

The more people use Ara 3D Studio, the more powerful the SDK becomes — and the closer we get to reshaping how the AEC industry designs, analyzes, and builds.
