# Ara 3D Studio

**Ara 3D Studio** is a free Windows desktop application for loading, viewing, and querying large 3D models in architecture, engineering, construction, and urban planning.

> **Note:** Ara 3D Studio is free to use but **not open-source**. The plugin and scripting ecosystem is built on the fully open-source [Ara 3D SDK](https://github.com/ara3d/ara3d-sdk).

## Features (current)

- Load common 3D formats: **glTF (GLB/GLTF), IFC, VIM, OBJ, STL, Collada (DAE)**
- Inspect and navigate large models interactively
- Run **C# scripts** and **plug-ins** via the open SDK
- Create **parametric geometry** and apply **parametric modifiers**
- Data-driven workflows aimed at fast iteration and validation

*(For planned features and priorities, see the roadmap.)*

## Our vision

We aim to make AEC software as efficient and dependable as the projects it supports.  
Ara 3D Studio and the Ara 3D SDK apply modern software practices to large-scale geometry and data so you can explore, query, and validate models with less friction.

Our focus:
- **Performance:** handle large models smoothly on everyday hardware  
- **Interoperability:** work alongside existing authoring tools and open formats  
- **Extensibility:** a simple SDK for scripting, plug-ins, and custom workflows

## FAQ

**Q: Why is this free?**  
Ara 3D Studio helps us validate the SDK and core algorithms with real projects. Making it free lowers the barrier to adoption, improves feedback loops, and grows the ecosystem that the SDK enables.

**Q: Why isn’t the app open-source?**  
We keep the app closed to protect years of R&D and to ship a consistent, reliable experience. We keep the **SDK open** so anyone can build plug-ins, scripts, and integrations.

**Q: Who is it for?**  
Architects, engineers, BIM/VDC teams, researchers, and developers who need to load, inspect, and query large models efficiently.

**Q: Is this a replacement for authoring tools?**  
No. Ara 3D Studio is a **companion** for exploration, analysis, and validation. Keep using your authoring tools; use Ara 3D Studio to move faster when you need to inspect, query, or automate.

**Q: Can I use this at work?**  
Yes. It is free for commercial use. A no-cost registration is required to issue a commercial license.

**Q: How does Ara 3D make money?**  
Through commercial services, libraries, integrations, and enterprise support built around the SDK and Studio.

**Q: What data leaves my machine?**  
Only the registration details you explicitly provide (email and name) for commercial licenses. No telemetry or model data is sent.

**Q: How can I contribute?**  
- Build plug-ins and scripts with the **[Ara 3D SDK](https://github.com/ara3d/ara3d-sdk)**  
- File bugs and feature requests in this repo’s **Issues**  
- Share example datasets and workflows that stress real-world needs
