# Ara 3D Studio

[**Ara 3D Studio**](https://github.com/ara3d/ara3d-studio/releases) is a free Windows desktop application for loading, viewing, and querying large 3D models such as those used in architecture, engineering, construction, and urban planning. You can load GLTF, GLB, VIM, DAE,  

The plugin and scripting ecosystem and geometry kernel is built on the fully open-source and dependency free [Ara 3D SDK](https://github.com/ara3d/ara3d-sdk).

## Our vision

We aim to make AEC software as efficient and dependable as the projects it supports.  
Ara 3D Studio and the Ara 3D SDK apply modern software practices to large-scale geometry and data so you can explore, query, and validate models with less friction.

Our focus:
- **Performance:** handle large models smoothly on everyday hardware  
- **Interoperability:** work alongside existing authoring tools and open formats  
- **Extensibility:** a simple SDK for scripting, plug-ins, and custom workflows

## Troubleshooting

If Ara 3D Studio fails silently, or the main window never shows, try launching the application from the command prompt (cmd.exe) or using power shell. 
You will get a more useful error message.

## FAQ

**Q: Why is this free?**  
Ara 3D Studio helps us validate the SDK and core algorithms with real projects. Making it free lowers the barrier to adoption, improves feedback loops, and grows the ecosystem that the SDK enables.

**Q: Why isn’t the app open-source?**  
We keep the app closed to protect years of R&D and to ship a consistent, reliable experience. We keep the **SDK open** so anyone can build plug-ins, scripts, and integrations.

**Q: Who is it for?**  
Architects, engineers, BIM/VDC teams, researchers, and developers who need to load, inspect, and query large models efficiently.

**Q: Is this a replacement for authoring tools?**  
No. Ara 3D Studio is a **companion** for exploration, analysis, and validation. Keep using your authoring tools; use Ara 3D Studio to move faster when you need to inspect, query, or automate.

**Q: Can I use this at work?**  
Yes. It is free for commercial or personal use.

**Q: How does Ara 3D make money?**  
Through commercial services, libraries, integrations, and enterprise support built around the SDK and Studio.
